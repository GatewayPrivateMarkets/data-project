### 1. Project Overview
The objective of this project is to create a flexible and scalable system that enables users to interact with AI-powered bots. These bots will use specialized knowledge databases stored in Google Drive to deliver personalized responses. Users can communicate with these bots through WhatsApp or a dedicated web interface, providing versatility in access methods depending on user preference and context.
This specification outlines a potential way to implement this system, leveraging technologies like Google Drive for storage, OpenAI GPT-4 for AI capabilities, Twilio for WhatsApp communication, and a web interface for desktop access. We are open to exploring alternative technologies or approaches that might enhance performance, security, or user experience.
### 2. System Components
- Google Drive: Storage for each bot's knowledge database and instruction files.
- OpenAI API with GPT-4: Powers the AI responses for each bot.
- WhatsApp Business Account and Twilio Account: Manages messaging services via WhatsApp.
- Website Interface: Allows desktop access with authentication and interaction capabilities.
- Langchain: Manages API integrations and conversation logic.
### 3. Functional Requirements
#### 3.1 Google Drive Integration
- Folder Structure and Access:
- Main Directory: Contains a file with user credentials and bot access information.
- Sub-Directories: Each bot has its own folder containing multiple file formats to support diverse knowledge bases:
- PDF Files: For detailed reports and guides.
- Word Documents: For formatted text and structured documents.
- Excel Files: For data sheets and analytical data.
- Text Files: For quick notes and raw data.
- Instructions File (instructions.txt): Contains operational guidelines and interaction scripts for the bot.
#### 3.2 OpenAI API
- Model Configuration: Utilizes the GPT-4 model, configured per bot requirements.
#### 3.3 WhatsApp and Twilio Integration
- Communication Management: Handle incoming and outgoing messages through WhatsApp.
- User Verification: Authenticate users based on phone number via Twilio.
#### 3.4 Website Interface
- Authentication: Users log in using their mobile number and a password.
- Interaction Panel: A simple UI similar to WhatsApp, where users send and receive messages.
#### 3.5 Langchain Setup
- API Management: Integrates and manages Google Drive, OpenAI, Twilio, and website communications.
- Logic Handling: Ensures responses are consistent with user queries and bot instructions.
#### 3.6 Security and Access Control
- Authentication Mechanism: Secure authentication for both website and WhatsApp access.
- Data Privacy: Ensure encryption and compliance with data protection regulations.
### 4. Technical Specifications
#### 4.1 Technologies
- Web Development Frameworks: For building the web interface (e.g., React, Vue.js).
- Backend Platform: For handling server-side logic and API integration (e.g., Node.js, Python).
- Database Management: For storing user credentials and session data (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
#### 4.2 Architecture
- Hybrid Cloud Approach: Utilize serverless functions for scalability combined with dedicated servers for managing persistent connections and sensitive operations.
### 5. User Flow
1.	User initiates interaction via WhatsApp or through the website.
2.	Authentication: User logs in on the website using their mobile number and password, or is authenticated by Twilio via WhatsApp.
3.	Langchain processes the request: Retrieves data from Google Drive and interfaces with OpenAI's GPT-4 to generate a response.
4.	Response delivery: Through WhatsApp or displayed on the website, depending on the interaction mode.
6. Development Milestones
- Infrastructure Setup: Establish both communication channels and all required integrations.
- User Interface Development: Design and implement the web interface.
- Authentication System: Build and secure the login mechanism.
- API Integration and Testing: Connect all components and conduct thorough testing.
- Pilot Launch and Feedback Collection: Go live with a controlled user group to gather insights.
- Final Deployment and Scaling: Adjust based on feedback and scale the solution.
 
## Bonus Section: Data Structuring Bot
### Objective
The goal is to develop a sophisticated bot that automates the process of converting unstructured data from various file formats (such as text files, web scraping documents, and Excel sheets) into a structured database. This bot will enhance data usability and support more complex data analysis and querying capabilities, serving as an advanced feature once the initial system is operational.
### Functional Requirements
- Data Extraction: The bot will be capable of parsing and extracting relevant information from a variety of unstructured formats stored in its designated Google Drive folder.
- Data Transformation: Implement algorithms to clean, normalize, and transform extracted data into a uniform format.
- Database Integration: Load the structured data into a centralized database, ensuring that it is stored in a manner that facilitates easy access and analysis.
- Update and Synchronization: Regularly update the database as new files are added to the Google Drive folders, ensuring all data remains current and synchronized.
### Technical Specifications
- Supported File Formats:
- Text Files (.txt): Extract textual data from reports or notes.
- Web Scraping Documents: Process HTML or other formats obtained from web scraping to extract structured information.
- Excel Files (.xlsx): Parse spreadsheets to retrieve data from cells, rows, and columns.
- Database Management System (DBMS):
- Technologies: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or any other suitable DBMS depending on the data structure requirements.
- Data Processing Libraries:
- Python Libraries: Pandas for data manipulation, BeautifulSoup or Scrapy for parsing web documents, and openpyxl or xlrd for handling Excel files.
### Implementation Strategy
- Script Development: Develop scripts using Python that can run scheduled tasks for extracting and processing data.
- Data Validation: Include validation steps to ensure data accuracy and integrity during the transformation process.
- Database Design: Design a database schema that is optimized for the types of queries expected by the users.
- Automation: Utilize cron jobs or workflow automation tools to periodically trigger the data processing scripts.
### User Flow
1.	Data Input: Users upload unstructured data files to specific Google Drive folders assigned to the bot.
2.	Processing: The bot automatically triggers processing tasks at scheduled intervals to extract and transform the data.
3.	Database Loading: Structured data is loaded into the database, ready for access and analysis.
4.	Notification: Users receive notifications on data updates and can access the structured data through custom queries or predefined reports.
### Development Milestones
- Prototype Development: Create a basic version of the bot that can handle one file type and perform simple data structuring tasks.
- Full-scale Development: Extend the bot's capabilities to handle multiple file types and complex data structures.
- Integration Testing: Test the bot with the existing system to ensure seamless integration.
- Deployment: Launch the bot as an additional feature once the main system is stabilized.
